Hello Mr. Jugoon!

Thank you for checking out this README.

I have inserted multiple iterations of my project from different points of my progression in this repository. They are named appropriately, with the final version (a.k.a. the one you want to mark) labelled as so. The other iterations are referenced in my C1.

To run any of the programs, download the program and the two .csv files (the program requires those two data files to run).

Enjoy!
